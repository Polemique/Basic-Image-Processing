Welcome to the Harris Corner Detector project! This repository hosts an implementation of the Harris Corner Detector, a widely used algorithm in computer vision for detecting key features or interest points in an image.

The Harris Corner Detector is an algorithm developed by Chris Harris and Mike Stephens in 1988. It identifies corners in an image by analyzing changes in intensity and gradient in different directions. This makes it particularly useful for various computer vision applications, such as feature matching, object recognition, and image stitching.
